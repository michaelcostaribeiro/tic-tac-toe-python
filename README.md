Tic-tac-toe in Python. Not finished yet.

It's a little fun and classic game that every child has played at some point!

While developing this project i've practiced a lot of things in Python, such as the use of arrays and functions.

As my mission for the development of this game i've pointed out some things i must do for it to work, such as:
[] Make a function that shows the board.
[] Make a function so the player can play X or O on the board. 
[] Make a function that calls the winner.
[] Do a draw-check every time a player plays.
[] Make it so the game shows when it's over, call the winner and ask if they wanna play again.
